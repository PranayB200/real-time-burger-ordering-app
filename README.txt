* To Run:
	yarn dev
	yarn watch (on another terminal) (search laravel mix)

* For Secret Key storage:
	dotenv
	
	(to separate the secret keys of the sessions from server.js (as server.js is public)).

* Database:
	MongoDB Compass

* Layout Engine:
	ejs

	(This is to avoid repeatitive code for something that we need in all the web-pages, for eg: nav-bar).

* Controllers:
	To separate the routes from the server.js file

* To have the cookies in the DB instead of Memory:
	connect-mongo
